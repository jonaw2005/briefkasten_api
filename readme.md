## Project overview
Explain the purpose and high-level behavior of the code base:
- What problem it solves
- Key components and responsibilities
- Runtime and environment assumptions (OS, required runtime like Node/Python/.NET, minimum versions)

## Code layout
Replace these entries with the actual files and folders present in this repository.

- README.md — this file.
- src/ or lib/ — application source code. Put main entry points and modules here.
    - src/main.* — program entry (CLI, server, or library initializer).
    - src/<module>.* — important modules and their responsibilities.
- bin/ or scripts/ — helper scripts and CLI wrappers.
- tests/ or spec/ — unit and integration tests.
- docs/ — reference documentation and design notes.
- config.* — configuration files (example: config.yml, .env.example).
- package.json / pyproject.toml / csproj — build and dependency files.

For each file or directory, add a one-line explanation of its role.

## Quick start
Prerequisites
- Install required runtimes and tools (example: Node.js >= 16, Python 3.10, .NET 7).

Install dependencies (replace with your package manager)
- Node: npm install
- Python: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run locally
- Application: replace with the actual run command
    - npm start
    - python -m src.main
    - dotnet run --project src

## Development
Building
- Provide build command and artifacts location (dist/, build/).

Configuration
- Explain environment variables or config files required. Point to example files (.env.example).

Code style and linting
- Commands for linters and formatters (eslint, prettier, black, dotnet format).
    - npm run lint
    - npm run format

## Tests
How to run tests and expected behavior
- npm test
- pytest
- dotnet test

Describe test structure and where to add new tests.

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and their fixes
- Missing dependencies: run the install command
- Configuration errors: check config.example or .env

## Contributing
How to contribute
- Fork, create a branch, make changes, add tests, open a PR.
- Describe branching, commit message style, code review expectations.

## License
State the repository license (e.g., MIT). Add LICENSE file.

## Contact / Maintainers
List maintainers and preferred contact method (email, issues in repo).

How to update this README
1. Replace each placeholder section with concrete information taken from the files in this folder.
2. For "Code layout" open each top-level file and add a one-line description near its entry.
3. Add example commands that match this project's actual build/run/test steps.

If you want, provide a directory listing or paste the main files and I will expand this README with exact, file-level explanations.
